		<p>This boy is a great friend, a huge Chelsea fan like really huge, you may see him hooting and screaming wearing a Chelsea jersey, he hasn't gone mad, he's just celebrating! Randomly falls from buses, scooties and sometimes while standing too! Soon to be a doctor but already treats his friends with love and care. He may be clumsy and may keep falling off places but he's a steady friend, you'll find him next to you in every situation no matter what. But you dare not say a word about Chelsea or he'll rip you apart. He will never fail to put a smile on your face. He may ditch for a Chelsea match but he's a gem and you can't deny that.

		<p class="lead">Years ago a guy named "Chirag Cool Gupta" made two special bonds, who knew years later they'll all come together and form a dynamic trio. 
			He made friends with Panamro during school years and had the best time of his life. 
			He had quite a journey with the Reigning Queen from being competitors to the best of friends. 
			He was having the best of both of both worlds and on the fateful day of 2 April, they all came together. Since then, the madness has kicked off. From talking for hours at night to crying at odd hours, from being the reason why each of them smile to being a patient listener and a shoulder to cry on, from madly laughing at the stupidest things to having heated discussions about politics. The journey has been beautiful and as it is said that unexpected friendships are the best, we are a living proof that this all is true. Even amidst the lowdown, we look forward to the calls and virtually being there for each other because that is certainly the best part of the day. Panamro and Reigning Queen may not appreciate or say it enough but they certainly love Chirag Cool Gupta the most, he means a lot to them and they can go to any lengths to put a smile on his face. Looking forward to many more years of togetherness (even when you come to our place for dinner or may lay the there the whole day) and cherishing the memories we created so far that are etched in our hearts forever! We bluey promise to stick by your side always (if you promise to not give political opinions) and any trouble that comes to you shall have to deal with us first before it reaches you! 
			We shall be looking back to these memories 8 years from now in our living room and have a hearty laugh!

					   Happiest Birthday Partner. We have had a great journey together, we grew so close and I'm not even surprised because I've always believed that good people end up with good people. It has been wonderful to be with you. We have dealt with the greatest of things together and we certainly can deal with anything together. I really can't thank you enough for listening to me crib, being my side, giving me the best advices to making me laugh after I cry. You have been the one stop solution to all my problems and I genuinely consider myself really lucky to have known you for such a long time and to have grown closer to you with the passage of time. I don't know what would I do without you and how lost I would have been. In every crowded place I look for your face and feel comfortable. You are genuinely a wonderful person at heart and certainly deserve the best if everything. I have lived the best moments of my life with you from being the head boy and head girl to playing shikanjee with Chirag, which is my favourite game. Just remember, you'll always find me towards your right in evey situation and we'll deal with everything. I fall short of words when it comes to you, I can't tell how much you mean to me, I'm just blessed to have you. I really love you, let people be jealous of us and we'll keep burning the wrath always, together!! 💙❤

					Happy Birthday Munniya!! This is first time I'm writing a paragraph for you that too in ENGLISH because bhai bhai mein yeh sab nhi hota na 😂
Have a great great year ahead, just be a little careful while you sit on a scooty because I won't be able (willing as well) take you to the hospital in my arms. I know it's a dream for you but NO MEANS NO!! 
But on a serious note, you really mean a lot to me and I will always wish the best for you (unless it's Chelsea v/s Barcelona) because you deserve the best and nothing less. I may not express this enough kyuki samjhdar ko toh sirf ishara kaafi hota hai.. Oh sorry sorry.. Tu samajhdaar kaha.. Tujhe toh batana padega. You are really a very important part of my life and I know that you're always a call away or maybe two because sometimes tu call nhi uthata. But I promise to stick by your side always and we can sail through all the tough times. Don't worry saath baith ke ghum bhulayenge. 
In the enemd A very very Happy Birthday Chirgaa. 
And Bhai please de de!?

A brother in true sense!
Thank you for thinking about me as your little sister, listening to me when I needed and guiding me the right direction! 

You owned my real respect on the day of competition if you remember. I don't know if you do. Wherein I was completely disheartened because I prepared for something else and competition was all the more different. You comforted me though aapke sath bhi same tha😂😂  Chalo ab ye chhodo

You are extremely rare kinda person I really pray to the almighty for success and I hope you soar higher always and win over all the difficulties you come across! You carry an indomitable spark in you and I know you won't let it die and achieve what you aspire....

Happiest birthday once again!
